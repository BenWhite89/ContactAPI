This application requires a elasticsearch running on localhost port 9200. 
To begin, ensure you've cloned the repository, then navigate to the project folder. 
Install all dependencies (npm install). 
Then start the server (npm run dev). 
While the server is running, you can run the pre-built test cases in another terminal window (npm run test).
